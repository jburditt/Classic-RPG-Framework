# WARNING
This project in it's current state is very difficult to compile and run. If you want to build and run the project, please notify me and I can help. Currently I'm the sole contributor and I'm using it as a playground.

## Getting started
Install MonoGame (3.6 or higher recommended). Run project "Tide" to edit your project or create a new project. Run project "MonoGame" to run your project. You will need to manually edit the hard-coded string for map name [for the time being]. If you add any graphics to the "MonoGame\Content" folder you will need to run project "Console" or you will not be able to run the game. Console reads the content folder and builds a new Content.mcbd file for MonoGame. If you have any difficulties feel free to ask for help.

## Note
Requires MonoGame installed. Could be used with another graphics library or Unity. Visual Studio 2017 and .NET 4.6.2 recommended.
